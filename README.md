# Stellar_calc
Stellar Structure and Evolution, Fall 2023


The final_table3.fits file contains the complete table with values from the stellar structure calculation. The actual calculation is available in the stellar_struct_calc.ipynb file (which will need the opacity.txt file derived from an OPAL opacity table to run). The comparison to MESA values is made in the mesa_output_final.ipynb file. The input file provided to run MESA is the inlist_project file.
